# CONTRIBUTING

## Contents

* source files: as a template repository, "source files" are ".cls", ".sty" and some related files with other extension names.
* doc files: including all ".tex" files and even "main.tex", which show how to use "source files".
* config files: These files make our development and use of templates more standardized (e.g. .gitignore, .latexmkrc, .editorconfig).

## How to contribute

We recommend following this workflow step by step:

1. Fork this repository as the upstream repository.
2. Clone the repository forked from remote to local.
3. Create a new local branch as a work branch.
4. Commit some changes to the work branch.
5. Push the new local branch to remote with commits.
6. Pull a request from the new remote branch to any branch of the upstream repository.
